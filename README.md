# Ontology Processing and Profile Generation Workflow

The ontology processing and profile generation workflow is intended for validating and generating MagicDraw-compatible SysML profiles for core IMCE ontologies. It uses OWL ontologies (*TODO: OML AS INPUT*) as input. The following will walk through the environment setup, and give instructions on how to run the workflow (a) locally and (b) on a CI system such as Jenkins.

## Environment Setup and Prerequisites

Running the workflow requires a number of tools to be configured: JRuby, SBT, Java 8 (JDK), Make. When using a CI server (such as Jenkins), a number of plugins are recommended to be installed. This is mentioned at the bottom of this section.

### JRuby
Ensure that JRuby 1.7.24 is installed. **Note:** it is important to install version 1.7.24, since there have been incompatible changes to the syntax and supported libraries in later versions.

JRuby 1.7.24 can be fetched from [here](http://jruby.org/files/downloads/1.7.24/index.html). Ensure that an environment variable `JRUBY` exists, or that the command `which jruby` directs to the correct installation. 

### Java 8 JDK
Install the latest version of the Java 8 JDK from [Oracle's website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). It is recommended **not** to use OpenJDK. 

Java 8 JDK may already be pre-installed on your system. To check if this is the case, run `java -version` in a terminal window.

### SBT 0.13.x
Install the latest version of SBT 0.13.x from the [Scala SBT website](http://www.scala-sbt.org/). **Note:** do NOT use SBT 1.x (currently a pre-release / beta) - there are known differences in syntax that will break part of the workflow.

### Make
Ensure that "make" is installed on the system. This is typically already the case for most Unix-based systems. Make is part of the [GNU Utils](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). On MacOSX, this may require installing Xcode.

### Valid License Server Connection for MagicDraw 18.0 sp6
Ensure that a valid connection to a license server is available. This is only required if profiles are to be produced.

### Note For Running Under Continuous Integration
When running in a CI system (such as Jenkins), the agent may need to be configured appropriately. For Jenkins:

* Add an environment variable JRUBY under "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Nodes" > (node name) > "Configure". The value should be *the absolute path to the jruby executable*: e.g., /usr/local/jruby/jruby-1.7.24/bin/jruby . **Note:** this is particularly important when using Jenkins 2.4.x, since Jenkins may NOT be aware of the system's environment settings.
* Install the SBT plugin (simply called "sbt plugin"), and configure an installation of SBT 0.13.x .

The above assumes a recommended standard installation of Jenkins 2.4.x, with the recommended plugins installed (e.g., GitHub plugin, JUnit plugin)

## Running
*MISSING: SETTING UP EXPORT RESULTS / RUNNING OML2OWL*

Before running the workflow, ensure that all encrypted data is decrypted locally. 

To run the pre-population and validation of ontologies, execute the following commands in a terminal, starting at the project root:

```sh
sbt setupOntologies setupTools setupFuseki
cd workflow
. env.sh
make bootstrap
make dependencies
make loadprod
cd ..
```

In the above, `sbt setupOntologies` will fetch the latest released version of the IMCE ontologies (1.+). These will then be processed and validated (which may take significant time), and loaded into a Fuseki instance (which is either set up as part of the workflow if not running, or a running instance is reused).

To generate profiles, execute the following additional steps:

```sh
cd workflow
make digests
make profiles
cd ..
```

This will first produce the *digest* artifacts by querying the running Fuseki instance, and then pass the digests on to the profile generation workflow. Note that profiles are generated using MagicDraw, which will require an active license server connection (license server is specified in the `build.sbt` file). This will also require credentials to be decrypted.

To produce an installable resource for MagicDraw, use the following command:

```sh
sbt packageProfiles
```

This will produce a MD-compatible resource / plugin in the "target" folder. Running `sbt publish` or `sbt publishSigned` will then upload this archive to bintray.

### Running Under CI
For Jenkins, a pipeline script can be found in the root directory. This file is called `Jenkinsfile`. **Note:** this file is currently under development.

To decrypt encrypted files automatically, use openssl as described in the scripts/travis-decode.sh file. Note that this requires setting an environment variable within the CI system (e.g., in Jenkins: "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Nodes" > (node name) > "Configure"; then set the environment variable ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD).
